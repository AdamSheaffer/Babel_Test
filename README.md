##Experimenting with Gulp and Babel

Goals for this experimentation
  - Transpile ES2015 to ES5
  - Generate Sourcemaps in build process
  - Create what will become boilerplate package.json and gulpfile.js for future projects
  - Have gulp run jasmine unit tests with Karma
  - Ensure that any failing gulp task will break a TFS build
